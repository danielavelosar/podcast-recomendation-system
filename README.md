# podcast reviews sentiment classifier
This project aims to practice TF-IDF for sentiment classification in a large data set 
## stages of the project
1. finding data. [This](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/podcastreviews) is the dataset I found in Kaggle
2. priming data. As a basic approach, I used a supervised dataset, I deleted other columns I did not  want to use and convert floats to integers
3. I applied TF-IDF algorithm 
4. I used Accuracy and F1 score to measure how the model performed.
